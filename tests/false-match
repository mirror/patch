# Check if patch incorrectly applies overlapping hunks: after the
# first hunk is applied, the second hunk should not apply
# anymore.  Older versions of patch didn't recognize that and did
# apply the second hunk on top of the first one, leading to the
# following incorrect result, with no information about hunk 2:
#
# Hunk #1 succeeded at 7 (offset 6 lines).

# printf '%s\n' x x x x x x 1 2 3 a a 4 5 6
